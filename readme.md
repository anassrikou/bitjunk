	#Description :
		It is a crypto currency with a Main purpose to make a Stock Exchange for Junk (result of the end of production)
    Not todays junk , but a Promise (estimation for future recyclable junk) in term of quantity and Expiration Date. 

    #Why Crypto Currency ?
		-you can't put an exact price for the junk , there is a lot of factors that drastically change it's Value  . 
		-In an other hand, it makes it possible, to buy , sell and acquire the "I OWE YOU" (IOU) for a service or product that 
		the Seller Factory need , without paying for it.
		-Keeping a trace related to all transactions , so that you can fallow the life cycle of your own product . If what you actually 
		Call a source material has parts of your own product and thus calculating your own product net worth. 

    #Technicalities :
    
		1. we created a server with NodeJs to handle the connection to the blockchain network
		2. a user of the network can check the list of junk items and choose to buy or add his own items to sell
		3. each user can purchase the item once and a period of time is passed for him to buy again if that item still exist
		4. each user has access to the transactions page which hold all the transactions made by the users
